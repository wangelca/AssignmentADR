# Scenario One
<br>
This ADR provides the decisions made to develop this app.<br>
<br>
A retail company has requested to create an application that allows customers to browse products, make payments, view orders, and track deliveries. One of the key features of this application is the ability to earn and redeem points for purchases. The application MUST support offline mode for uninterrupted browsing, with data syncing with servers once an internet connection is established. The application MUST also offer push notifications to update users on their order status, new products, and any promotions and offers. The application must also offer secure payment gateways for their customers that is both secure and convenient. Tracking user behavior via analytics tools will optimize performance, while managing varied product images necessitates image storage solutions with caching, lazy loading, and compression.
