# Scenario Two
<br>
This ADR provides the decisions made to develop this app.<br>
<br>
This application is focused on creating a social networking app for students and instructors for a university. The goal of the app is to increase student connectivity and socialization while enchaning academic management for instructors. Students would be able to connect with peers and share class information, view campus events, and manage their schedules. Instructors would be able to post announcements, assignments, and grades. Offline mode is essential for users, creating the necessity for offline mode and data synchronization. The application MUST be compatible with varied devices, to cater to a larger population and promote diversity. Integrating with Active Directory ensures secure user authentication and role-based access control. Push notifications will keep users updated on announcements and deadlines across platforms. Data privacy and security are prioritized through encryption and adherence to regulations, given the handling of sensitive information. Lastly, accessibility features like text-to-speech and high contrast modes ensure inclusivity and usability for all users.
